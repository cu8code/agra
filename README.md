# Rust-Based Linux Application Launcher

## Overview
This project is a highly customizable application launcher for Linux, built using Rust. Unlike minimalist application launchers, this one focuses on flexibility, creativity, and integration with various services. It is designed to let you craft unique experiences that reflect your personality and preferences.

The launcher is intended to:
- Provide extreme customizability.
- Enable the creation of dynamic views.
- Integrate with random services seamlessly.
- Ship with experimental or broken features for exploration.

No one uses this yet, so feel free to experiment and break things!

## Features
- **Customizable Layouts**: Design your application launcher to look and behave exactly as you want.
- **Service Integration**: Integrate services directly into the launcher.
- **Creative Freedom**: Add or modify features to suit your unique needs.
- **Support for Experimental Features**: Try out new ideas without worrying about breaking things.
